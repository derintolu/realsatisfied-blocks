    // Decode HTML entities first
    $text = html_entity_decode($text, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8');
    
    // Handle specific encoding artifacts
    $replacements = array(
        'Ã¢â‚¬â„¢' => "'",      // Smart apostrophe
        'Ã¢â‚¬Å“' => '"',      // Smart quote open
        'Ã¢â‚¬\x9d' => '"',   // Smart quote close
        'Ã¢â‚¬"' => 'â€“',      // En dash
        'Ã¢â‚¬"' => 'â€”',      // Em dash
        'Ã¢â‚¬Â¦' => 'â€¦',      // Ellipsis
        'ÃƒÂ¡' => 'Ã¡',      // Ã¡ with accent
        'ÃƒÂ©' => 'Ã©',      // Ã© with accent
        'ÃƒÂ­' => 'Ã­',      // Ã­ with accent
        'ÃƒÂ³' => 'Ã³',      // Ã³ with accent
        'ÃƒÂº' => 'Ãº',      // Ãº with accent
        'ÃƒÂ±' => 'Ã±',      // Ã±
    );
    
    $text = str_replace(array_keys($replacements), array_values($replacements), $text);
    
    // Additional cleanup
    $text = preg_replace('/[^\x20-\x7E\x{00A0}-\x{024F}\x{1E00}-\x{1EFF}]/u', '', $text);
    $text = trim(preg_replace('/\s+/', ' ', $text));
    
    return $text;
}
```

**Result**: Completely resolved encoding issues across all blocks and data sources.

### Phase 4: Block Registration & Architecture Optimization with GitHub Copilot (Days 7-8)
**Challenge**: Inconsistent block registration and double instantiation issues

**Copilot Assistance**:
- Analyzed WordPress block registration patterns
- Suggested PHP-based registration over block.json for complex blocks
- Generated proper hook timing and initialization code
- Created debugging scripts for block registration issues

**Solutions**:
1. **PHP Registration Pattern**:
```php
// In main plugin file init() method
if (class_exists('RealSatisfied_Office_Testimonials_Block')) {
    $office_testimonials_block = new RealSatisfied_Office_Testimonials_Block();
    $office_testimonials_block->register_block();
}
```

2. **Proper Hook Timing**:
```php
// Call register_block directly since we're already in init hook
add_action('init', array($this, 'init'));
```

3. **Asset Loading Optimization**:
```php
// Conditional script loading based on block presence
if (has_block('realsatisfied-blocks/office-testimonials')) {
    wp_enqueue_script_module(
        'realsatisfied-office-testimonials-view',
        RSOB_PLUGIN_URL . 'blocks/office-testimonials/view.js',
        array('@wordpress/interactivity'),
        RSOB_PLUGIN_VERSION
    );
}
```

### Phase 5: Office Agents Block Development & Removal with GitHub Copilot (Days 9-10)
**Challenge**: Create a new block for displaying office agents with reviews

- Built sorting, filtering, and pagination features
- Generated responsive CSS grid layouts

**Implementation**:
- Full block implementation with editor and frontend components
- Agent data parsing and display
- Multiple layout options (grid, list, slider)
- Comprehensive styling and responsive design

**Decision to Remove**:
After implementation, determined the block was not useful because:
- Only showed agents who had reviews (very limited data)
- Did not provide comprehensive agent directory functionality
- Better handled by dedicated agent directory solutions

**Copilot Assistance with Removal**:
- Identified all files and references to remove
- Generated cleanup scripts
- Ensured no orphaned code remained

### Phase 6: Office Stats Block Planning with GitHub Copilot (Day 11)

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. WordPress Interactivity API Adoption
**Rationale**: Future-proof, performant, WordPress-native solution

**Benefits**:
- Smaller JavaScript footprint than jQuery
- Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement
- Native WordPress integration
- Better performance and maintenance

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// view.js structure
import { store } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

store('realsatisfied/office-testimonials', {
    state: {
        currentPage: 1,
        filterCustomerType: 'all',
        filterMinRating: 0,
        isLoading: false
    },
    actions: {
        nextPage: () => {
            // Implementation
        },
        applyFilters: () => {
            // Implementation
        }
    }
});
```

### 2. RSS Data Architecture
**Foundation**: Built upon the proven RSS parsing functions from the RealSatisfied Review Widget plugin

**Original Widget Contributions**:
- `rsrw_obtain_channel_tag_data()` - Channel-level data extraction
- `rsrw_obtain_item_tag_data()` - Individual item data parsing  
- Namespace handling for RealSatisfied XML structure
- Basic error handling patterns

**Our Enhancements**: Modernized and improved the existing patterns
```php
class RealSatisfied_Office_RSS_Parser {
    // Based on original widget's parsing functions but with:
    // - Object-oriented structure
    // - Enhanced error handling
    // - Improved character encoding
    // - Modern WordPress patterns
    
    private function obtain_channel_tag_data($rss_source, $namespace, $tag_name) {
        // Extracted and improved from rsrw_obtain_channel_tag_data()
    }
    
    private function obtain_item_tag_data($rss_item, $namespace, $tag_name) {
        // Extracted and improved from rsrw_obtain_item_tag_data()
    }
}
```

### 3. Block Structure Pattern
**Standard Structure** for each block:
```
block-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ block-name.php              # PHP registration and rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ block-name-editor.js        # Gutenberg editor configuration
â””â”€â”€ view.js                     # Frontend Interactivity API
```

### 4. Asset Loading Strategy
**Conditional Loading**: Only load assets when blocks are present
```php
// Check multiple conditions for script loading
if (has_block('realsatisfied-blocks/office-testimonials') || 
    $this->is_likely_office_page()) {
    // Load scripts
}
```
